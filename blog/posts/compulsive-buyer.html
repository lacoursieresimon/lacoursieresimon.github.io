<p>Let’s start with a bit of history about me
When I got my first part time job, 5 or 6 years ago, I was still living at my parents house.
I was in college, and tuition fees are really cheap where I live and
I had no fixed fees like groceries or a rent, so all the money I made was ready to be used for whatever I liked.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really a party kind of person either. 
When most of the people I knew at the time where spending their job’s money on alcohol and restaurants, 
I was mostly at home on the computer.
I did started to pile up some cash and started spending it at the same time on stuff I wanted.
I was deeply in music recording at the time, so pretty much all my income would go into that.
A few years later, I had an amazing home studio with thousands and thousands of dollars worth of gear.
I also started to get into video making and I got geared up as well in that field, the same way I did with audio stuff.</p>

<p>Those hobbies were really great! 
They stimulated my creativity and challenged my skills as an artist, but also as a film maker, a producer and a sound engineer!
I’ve done so many amazing projects that I’m still proud of today and I wouldn’t change any of that.
However, they also created an habit of spending money on highly priced equipement, and I always had a good reason to buy new gear.
“With this audio interface, I’ll get a way better sound!”, or “with that lens, I’ll get a sharper image!”.
There was always better gear out there that I could buy, and I could always find a reason to buy it.
I’ve gone through so much gear, it’s pretty unbelievable.</p>

<p>As an example, I’ve had maybe 7 or 8 different audio interfaces in the last years, 
some worth over a thousand dollars and some as low as one hundred, like the one I own at the moment.</p>

<p>Most of the time I bought things, I could sell them afterward, 
but lost money a lot of time at each transaction, money that I could’ve keep for later.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that bad when I bought used gear, but for new gear, I always ended up losing money in the end.</p>

<p>Now, that’s a pretty cool story, but how did I stopped behaving like that?
Well, I started University in a computer science program where I have to be in internships half of the time.
Those require to move out to different cities every 4 month, taking your personal belongings with you at those various places.</p>

<p>At first, it was only worst, because I wanted to keep my setup as is at my parent’s place, while having a somewhat mobile setup wherever I was at the time.
I had two audio interfaces, two monitors, two mice, two keyboards and on and on.</p>

<p>That was bad!</p>

<p>As time went by, I started to loose interest in music recording, as it was too much time involving to continue it alongside my schooling.
This huge pile of gear began to start loosing the original emotionnal value I had for it.
Some of the gear I had had never been used either and it started to become some sort of burden.
I had all those things, that were worth so much, but that I didn’t like as much as I did before.</p>

<p>I then started to sell some of the things I was sure to never use again.
Selling things one after the other, I started to like how these were not my problem anymore, and weren’t taking up place at my parent’s house anymore.</p>

<p>Being on the go every 4 month, I liked the idea that I could fit all my life in the smallest area possible.
while It’s not something I was near of at the time, and still not there yet, I’ve done some solid work in the last year to improve that.</p>

<p>I made a list of pretty much everything I owned that had some sort of value, or that could be sold at a decent price.
I then made a second list with all the things I was ready to get rid of.</p>

<p>I found it helped me to have an idea of all the items I possessed and that gave me some sort of plan on which item to get rid of first.</p>

<p>Now, that’s pretty cool, but with all the money I got from selling stuff, I have to say that I was tempted to buy new things, and to go back in that never ending circle of going through new gear all the time.
You probably guessed that I’m now really into computer and desk related stuff, so it’s really easy for me to find new things to try out.</p>

<p>However, I live most of the time in tiny spaces, as I favor new or renovated appartments, I try to save on my rent by going for a smaller place at least, so it’s a must to own as few items as you can.
Also, the fact that I’m moving every 4 month makes it really interesting to be able to pack as little as possible.</p>

<p>So I’ve given myself some rules to follow to simplify those situations.</p>

<p>First of all, I have a “To Buy” list. Yep, you’Ve heard right.
There I list all the things I want to buy in the future.
Whenever I feel like buying something worth 20$ or more, that I will have to carry with me, I first add it to the list.
It helps me to take my time before really going for a new thing, so that I can think about how much I really want it, if it’s a necessity, and if I’ll have some place to store it away.
By the time, I’m ready to purchase the item, it happens quite often that I’ve decided to go for something else or simply that I don’t really need it.
Wether it is because I had the time to see how my life without having it goes, or because I had the time to check some reviews about it.</p>

<p>All in all, it helps me reduce my purchases and whenever I decide to buy something new, that’s because I’ve researched enough about it that I’m confident I’ll be satisfied with it.</p>

<p>Second, when I buy a product to replace one that I already own, wether because it is smaller or does a better job, 
I always try to sell or get rid of the actual item I already have that has the same purpose before buying the new one, or shortly after.</p>

<p>This older item is of no use anymore, and there’s no good reason to keep it around if it is being replaced entirely.
This allows me to only have exactly what I need at all time</p>

<p>Third, you should avoid buying temporary or bad quality products.
We’ve all done this before. 
Whenever you shop for a particular item and the one that would be of better quality or that suits best your needs might be a bit too much for what you wanted to pay initially, so you end up buying the cheaper option.
Wether it is a temporary option to fulfill that need, and you plan to buy the better option later on or not, I would avoid these kind of purchases.
In the end, you will loose money with the cheaper option, and maybe time if you try to resell it later, and you’ll have a worst experience.
If you wait a bit to have the cash for the right product, you won’t be disappointed, 
you’ll have the time to think about if you really want it or not and to research various other products 
and that will only help you to make a smarter purchase.</p>

<p>Fourth, as stated before, take your time to research on what you’re buying and to see if it’s worth it for you.
So many times, I’ve bought things thinking they would make me happier.
I was excited when I received the package, but after that, the item didn’t bring me much joy, and I forgot about it shortly after.
These were not worth the price I paid for them, as they didn’t add value in my life.
So make sure you take the time to put a value on what you buy, before doing so.
That can also help you knowing what you should buy first if you have a list of things to buy.</p>

<p>So, these were my tips.
They’ve been helpful for me, and while it’s still a work in progress, I’m confident I’ll reach my minimalism goals.</p>
